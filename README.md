Final Year Project

![FYP](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddbec609-008c-4c7c-bf72-cdd00dd808cd)

## Project Domain / Category
Machine learning , Data science
## Tools: 
### Language: Python 
### Framework: Anaconda
## Introduction:
This model will help patient as well as doctors to diagnose that a patient has a diabetes or not. It will be predicting the data on the basis of dataset.
A detailed informative data is given which will be used to train the model for prediction.
Display Data: Display the summary statistics, trends, patterns and insights on the data visually by performing the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis). 
## Pre-process the data:
Split the data into train (70% of given data set) and test (30% of given data set).
Train the model using Neural Network (machine learning algorithm).
## Testing:
Apply test data on trained model for evaluation.
## Training:
Train the data set for prediction.
## Apply models:
Apply SVM, Decision tree, Logistic regression on the train data.
## Results:
Predict a patient has diabetics or not. Generate a confusion matrix to assess the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score in the trained model.
## Accuracy:
Show which model give the high accuracy for prediction.
## Save Model:
Save the model for future use.
